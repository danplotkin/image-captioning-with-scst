# Advanced Image Captioning Transformer with Reinforcement Learning Optimization in PyTorch

## About

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a two-step training process to train an image captioner. We implement a baseline transformer image captioning model using the CPTR architecture, as described in the research paper "[CPTR: Full Transformer Network for Image Captioning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10804)" by Liu et al. (2021), and we then optimize this baseline model with Self Critical Sequence Training, proposed in "[Self-critical Sequence Training for Image Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00563)" by Rennie et al. (2016) which is an improved varient of the popular REINFORCE algorithm.
